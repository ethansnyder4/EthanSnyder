# EthanSnyder
I'm a current Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) student with a background in finance from the College of William & Mary, where I also competed as a Division I student-athlete on the baseball team. My academic and athletic experiences have shaped a disciplined, team-oriented mindset and a strong foundation in both quantitative analysis and strategic thinking.

I’m passionate about applying data-driven insights to solve real-world problems in business analytics and finance. With interests spanning financial modeling, valuation, and data visualization, I’m actively developing the technical and analytical skills needed to drive smart, impactful decisions in dynamic environments.
