# EthanSnyder
A driven and analytical business analytics graduate student with a strong foundation in finance from the College of William & Mary, I bring a unique blend of technical skill and strategic thinking to problem-solving. With hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, I’ve tackled real-world projects in commercial real estate valuation, commodity portfolio management, and public-sector budgeting.

My work reflects a deep understanding of financial principles, statistical modeling, and data storytelling, backed by tools like Python, Excel, Tableau, and Alteryx. I thrive in collaborative environments and value clarity, structure, and continuous improvement. Whether optimizing milk routes for supply chains or analyzing COVID-era cheese pricing for retailers, I approach every challenge with curiosity and commitment.

I’m currently exploring opportunities to grow as a financial or business analyst, where I can apply data-driven insights to support smarter decision-making and long-term value creation.
